<p class="Techniques" >But, if you want to use anything other than a pen or pencil, some of the easiest methods when creating artwork include painting with either acrylic or watercolour - not only is acrylic inexpensive, but it drys very quickly. Its versatility also makes for a beautiful creation.
Alike with watercolour, it is also inexpensive and easy to use. Although watercolour can be unforgiving at times due to its fluid nature, it can be a fun and expressive method to explore.</p>
