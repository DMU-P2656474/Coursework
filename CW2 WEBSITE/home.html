<p class="About" >Hello there, and welcome to the Captivating World of Art! Whether you are stopping by to get those creative juices flowing, seeking out a new hobby, or just looking to remove stress from your everyday life, then look no further.
  This website is all about exploring the depths of your mind, expressing your creativity or finding pleasure in art. Whether you are creating or viewing - the opportunities are endless.
You may be thinking to yourself, "but I'm no Picasso." but truthfully, you don't need to be to express your creative side.
Even if you feel bound to drawing stick men, you too can find joy in creating something unique to you.</p>
